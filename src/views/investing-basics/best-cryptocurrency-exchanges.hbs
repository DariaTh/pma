                How to choose the best crypto trading platform
            </h2>
            <p>There are several great cryptocurrency apps on the market. To choose the best exchange for crypto, you'll
                need to decide which crypto features matter most to you.
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul best-crypto-list">
                <li><span>Crypto platform security.</span> There are two components to cryptocurrency safety --
                    security and investment volatility.</li>
                <li><span>Different types of cryptocurrency available:</span> There are over 4,000 cryptocurrencies, but
                    even big exchanges only offer 50 to 150 coins.</li>
                <li><span>Crypto staking fees & crypto coin interest.</span> Several cryptocurrency exchanges offer ways
                    to earn interest on your coins.</li>
                <li><span>Crypto trading fees. </span>Fees can really eat into your profits, especially if you trade
                    regularly. The best U.S. cryptocurrency exchange apps will let you trade, deposit, and withdraw your
                    money at a minimal cost.</li>
                <li><span>Crypto app transaction options. </span>Check how much it costs to deposit, withdraw, and trade
                    before you open an account.</li>
                <li><span>Crypto app customer support. </span>24/7 customer service transaction support is a must if
                    you're new to cryptocurrency investing.</li>
                <li><span>Crypto app features & ease of usability.</span> Make sure the app has the features you want to
                    use, and if you've never traded before, pick one that is beginner-friendly. Note: some U.S. crypto
                    exchanges cannot operate in every U.S. state. Make sure the exchange you choose covers your state
                    and complies with U.S. crypto regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Investing in cryptocurrencies may not be right for everyone, as they're still a somewhat speculative
                investment. Whether or not they make money in the long term, investors can expect a roller coaster ride.
                That said, if you believe in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies and have a fairly high risk
                tolerance, there's nothing wrong with holding some digital currency as a long-term investment.

                Do you need a cryptocurrency wallet?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrency wallets are a safe way to store your digital assets, but you really only need one if you
                plan to amass large amounts of crypto assets or want to spend your crypto easily.<br>
                Some of the best exchanges for cryptocurrency, like Coinbase and Gemini have built-in wallets. Like any
                good exchange, each lets you transfer your currency to an external wallet as well, though you may have
                to pay a withdrawal fee. You may have to find a wallet that is compatible with your exchange.
