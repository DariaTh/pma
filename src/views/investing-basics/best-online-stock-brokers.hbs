                What is a stock broker?
            </h3>
            <p>
                A stock broker is a trading platform (or person) that facilitates the buying and selling of marketable securities like stocks and <a href="">exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Through a stock broker, you can open a brokerage account, a specialized financial account designed to hold investments and cash.
            </p>
            <p>
                The term is often used interchangeably with "brokerage," which is technically the name for a business that employs brokers or acts as a broker to facilitate trading.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you want to buy stock in a company, you can't simply call up the company and buy shares, and you can't just walk into your local bank and invest. You need a specialized brokerage account, and that's where stock brokers come in.

                What are the different types of brokerage accounts?
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are two main types of stock brokers: discount and full-service. They each come with distinct costs and levels of service.

                Discount broker
            </h3>
            <p>
                A discount broker is a company that lets an investor buy and sell securities online. As a customer, you can direct the process of buying and selling stocks or sign up for an account with a robo-advisor that'll automate your investments. Many discount brokers have features that help you decide how to direct your trades, but typically there's no human broker taking and filling your orders.
            </p>
            <p>
                True to their name, discount brokers are much cheaper than full-service brokers, and most offer zero-commission stock trading. For the vast majority of investors -- especially the <a href="">beginning investor</a> -- a discount broker is the best choice. That's why our picks for the best trading platform for beginners are exclusively discount brokers.

                Full-service broker
            </h3>
            <p>
                Think of a full-service broker as an old-school broker. It's a firm that usually operates out of a physical office where an actual person, also called a stock broker, takes and executes clients' buy and sell orders. A full-service broker might also provide personalized investment planning services, such as stock-buying advice, <a href="">tax guidance</a>, and retirement planning help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full-service brokers are far more expensive than discount brokers, given the costs of human advisors and brick-and-mortar locations. But costs have generally come down over the past few decades as they face competition from stock brokers, aim to make investing more accessible, and gain access to tools to automate work on their end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Full-service brokers are best suited to high-net-worth investors who want a personal level of service and dedicated investment portfolio management. Discount brokers are most appropriate for nearly all investors.

                How to pick the best online stock broker for beginners
            </h2>
            <p>
                There's no perfect broker for everyone, but here are some of the important factors to keep in mind as you're looking for a stock broker for beginners.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper text-wrapper-part">
            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">
                Cost structure:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The best brokerages for beginners charge no commissions for online stock and ETF trades (what you'll generally focus on as a beginner) -- but many do charge commissions or fees for more complex moves like options trading, mutual funds, and other products.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper text-wrapper-part">
            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">
                Account minimums:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Some stock brokers have a minimum deposit requirement to open an account, anywhere from $5 to $500, and some don't charge anything at all. We've narrowed our picks to brokers that don't have account minimums. Note that some brokers don't allow fractional share investing, so you'll need enough money to buy at least one share of a stock or ETF. These low-barrier-to-entry brokerages let anyone get started investing, even without a ton of capital.

                Variety of funds:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Picking individual stocks isn't right for everyone, especially beginners. The best investing platform for beginners offers low-cost exchange-traded funds and no-fee mutual funds to help you invest wisely without a ton of stock market knowledge.

            <p>
                Within the realm of stock brokers, you can choose between a cash account and a margin account:
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>
                    Cash account: You can only spend the money you have sitting in your account.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Margin account: You can borrow money from your broker to invest with. Trading on margin is a risky prospect, though, and isn't usually a great idea for beginner investors. Margin interest rates are generally high, and that's especially true in a rising-rate environment.
                </li>
                
            </ul>

                Features and support:

            <p>
                If you simply want to stick a recurring amount of money into low-cost ETFs and let your money grow, a no-frills investing app could be all you need. If you're interested in taking your investing to the next level and learning how to choose individual stocks and direct your portfolio yourself, look for a platform that includes educational resources, research, news, and customer support that'll help you make smart choices as you learn the ropes -- and one that offers more advanced trading features you can use as your knowledge grows.
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>
                    Research: Many of the best stock brokers for beginners offer access to research so you can read more about market sectors as well as individual stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds.

                <li>
                    News: Some stock trading platforms for beginners offer news updates, so you can keep tabs on companies and happenings in the stock market in general.

                <li>
                    Customer support: You should be able to pick up the phone and speak to a live person who can help you navigate any issues you experience.

                When you're new to investing, you may not be familiar with key terms that are necessary to manage your account. And if you don't know what a mutual fund is, you probably shouldn't buy one. Many stock brokers for beginners have an educational resources section loaded with information that can help you learn more about investing and gain confidence.

                Instead of working with a human broker or self-directing your stock trading account, you use a robo-advisor to set your portfolio on cruise control.

                Should beginner investors buy fractional shares?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many of the best trading platforms for beginners now offer the ability to buy and sell fractional shares of many popular stocks. Investors essentially buy a slice of a share, which opens up access to a wide universe of investments for beginner investors that would otherwise be unavailable when starting with a small portfolio. For example, some popular stocks can cost more than $1,000 per share. Buying these stocks would be impossible for someone starting out with, say, a $500 investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                But with fractional share investing, investors can buy slices of these stocks in smaller dollar amounts. Best yet, many of the best brokerage accounts for beginners have $0 commissions to invest in fractional shares and you can do so with as little as a few dollars.

                What do I need to open a brokerage account?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The process for opening a brokerage account is similar to the process for opening a checking or savings account. If you're using a stock broker, it should take just a few minutes, and it'll involve filling out a few simple forms.

            <p>
                To expedite the process, have this information available:
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>
                    Social Security number (SSN): Your broker needs your SSN for identity verification and to prepare year-end tax forms. If your account earns interest, receives dividend payments, or earns a profit (or loss) through sold investments, you'll have to report those on your tax return.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Driver's license or other government-issued ID: If you don't have a driver's license, you can typically use another state-issued ID or a U.S. passport to verify your identity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Funding method: The easiest way to fund a new brokerage account is by an ACH transfer from your bank account. So have your bank routing and account numbers or online banking password handy. Alternatively, you can mail a check or wire money (usually for a fee), and your broker might have additional funding options.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">Opening IRA accounts</h3>
            <p>
                The process for opening a traditional IRA account or Roth IRA account is no different. In fact, all an IRA account is a standard brokerage account that's taxed in a different manner. We mention this since one of the best steps new investors can take is to begin investing in a tax-advantaged account. Just like commissions, taxes can eat away at investment gains, and IRAs help shelter investors from paying these taxes.

                Trading commissions and account minimums
            </h2>
            <p>
                Trading commissions and account minimums are largely a thing of the past -- especially for most stock brokers. Almost no stock broker or investing app charges commission fees on basic trading, and most let you open an account with $0 deposited, or just a few dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, most still require a minimum amount of money to use more complex features, such as <a href="">margin investing</a>. And $0 commission typically applies to stock and ETF trades; some brokers charge commissions for trading options and <a href="">mutual funds</a>, among other products. Take a look at a broker's full fee schedule before you open an account to make sure it makes sense for how you intend to invest.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, note that ETFs, mutual funds, and other types of funds you invest in usually come with fees of their own, called an expense ratio. This is a cost outside of your broker's control, but your broker will usually let you know the <a href="">expense ratios</a> for funds it lets you invest in.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper text-wrapper-part">
            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">Why commissions and fees matter</h3>
            <p>
                Here's why trading commissions are so important: Say your broker charges a $6.99 commission for online stock trades and you have <a href="">$1,000 to invest</a>. You want to spread your money across a portfolio of five stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                To make your initial investments, you'll pay nearly $35 in trading commissions. On a $1,000 investment, you're effectively starting with a 3.5% loss in your portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, you'll pay another $6.99 each time you add to one of your stock positions. If you're planning to build up your portfolio over time, it's not hard to see how this can cost you thousands of dollars over the years.
            </p>
        </div> 
        <div class="text-wrapper text-wrapper-part">
            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">Keep in mind the account minimum</h3>
            <p>
                Most major stock brokers have no account minimum. This historically hasn't been the case. When I opened my first brokerage account over 20 years ago, I needed to deposit $2,000 just to get started.
            </p>
            <p>
                A low- or no-minimum-deposit requirement lets investors who don't have a ton of spare capital get started investing early, so you can gradually build your first investment portfolio and take advantage of long-term gains.
