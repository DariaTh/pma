            <p>
                The data we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, or for one of our suppliers. This includes staff engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your Personal Information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. The Profit Master Academy will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of our external third parties are based outside the EEA, so their processing of your Personal Information will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. Whenever we transfer your Personal Information out of the EEA to third parties, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>
                    <p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        where we use certain service providers, we ensure they adhere to specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your Personal Information the same protection it has in Europe.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

            <p>
                We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected. We may retain your personal information for longer if it may be the subject of a legal claim, or may otherwise be relevant for future litigation.
