            <p>First of all, congratulations! Investing your money is the most reliable way to build wealth over time.
                If you’re a first-time investor, we’re here to help you get started. It’s time to make your money work
                for you.
                <br>
                Before you put your hard-earned cash into an investment vehicle, you’ll need a basic understanding of
                how to invest your money the right way. However, there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The best way
                to invest your money is whichever way works best for you. To figure that out, you’ll want to consider
                your investing style, your budget, and your risk tolerance.

            <p>
                The investing world has two major camps when it comes to the ways to invest money: active investing and
                passive investing. We believe both styles have merit, as long as you focus on the long term and aren't
                just looking for short-term gains. But your lifestyle, budget, risk tolerance, and interests might give
                you a preference for one type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Active investing means taking time to research investments yourself and constructing and maintaining
                your portfolio on your own. If you plan to buy and sell individual stocks through an online broker,
                you're planning to be an active investor. To successfully be an active investor, you'll need three
                things:
            </p>

            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>Time: Active investing requires lots of homework. You'll need to research investment opportunities,
                    conduct some basic analysis, and keep up with your investments after you buy them.</li>
                <li>Knowledge: All the time in the world won't help if you don't know how to analyze investments and
                    properly research stocks. You should at least be familiar with some of the basics of how to analyze
                    stocks before you invest in them.</li>
                <li>Desire: Many people simply don't want to spend hours on their investments. And since passive
                    investments
                    have historically produced strong returns, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this approach.
                    Active
                    investing certainly has the potential for superior returns, but you have to want to spend the time
                    to
                    get it right.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                On the other hand, passive investing is the equivalent of putting an airplane on autopilot versus flying
                it manually. You'll still get good results over the long run, and the effort required is far less. In a
                nutshell, passive investing involves putting your money to work in investment vehicles where someone
                else is doing the hard work -- mutual fund investing is an example of this strategy. Or you could use a
                hybrid approach. For example, you could hire a financial or investment advisor -- or use a robo-advisor
                to construct and implement an investment strategy on your behalf.
