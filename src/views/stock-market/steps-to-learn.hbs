                Fortunately, the process of buying your first shares of stock online is relatively quick and easy.
                Here's a step-by-step guide to start your stock investing journey.

            <h3 class="internal-page-h3">1. Open a brokerage account</h3>
            <p>
                First, you'll need a brokerage account to buy stock. Consider two main factors when selecting an online
                stock brokerage:
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li>
                    <strong>What the brokerage offers:</strong> Does the brokerage firm offer every product and service
                    you need? Some brokerages publish excellent educational resources for new investors. Others provide
                    access to stock research and analytical tools. Some online brokerages maintain branches where you
                    can receive guidance in person. Perhaps other features, such as the ability to trade international
                    stocks or buy fractional shares, are important to you. Not all brokerages offer these.
                </li>
                <li class="text-wrapper-part">
                    <strong>The user-friendliness of the brokerage platform:</strong> Is the brokerage's platform easy
                    to navigate? If you want to trade using your mobile device, then the brokerage's mobile interface
                    needs to be well-designed. Many of the largest brokerages allow you to use play money to experience
                    their trading platforms before you invest, so try a few to decide which platform you like the most.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="text-wrapper text-wrapper-part">
            <p>
                Most major online brokerages, such as Charles Schwab (SCHW 0.99%), TD Ameritrade(NASDAQ:AMTD), and
                others, have recently eliminated trading commissions, which largely takes cost out of the equation when
                choosing a brokerage platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've chosen a brokerage, you'll need to complete a new account application. This is typically
                quick and easy, but you'll need to have photo identification handy, such as a driver's license and your
                Social Security number. You'll also need your bank account information if you want to fund your new
                brokerage account using your checking or savings account. You can choose to open a standard brokerage
                account, or instead establish an individual retirement account (IRA), which confers some pretty nice tax
                advantages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another decision you may face is whether to establish margin privilege for your new brokerage account.
                Having margin privilege enables you to buy stocks with money borrowed from your brokerage. While
                investing on margin is generally not a good idea, establishing margin privilege can confer some other
                benefits. For example, with margin privilege, you may begin trading in your brokerage account before
                your deposited funds have cleared.

            <p>
                Without going too deep into the many possible methods of analyzing and selecting individual stocks to
                buy, the next step is to determine which stocks you'd like to purchase. A couple of pointers:
            </p>
            <ul class="internal-page-ul">
                <li class="text-wrapper-part">
                    <strong>Follow a "buy and hold" strategy:</strong> Only buy stocks that you want to own for many
                    years. Don't buy a stock just because you think it will perform well over the next few weeks or
                    months.
                </li>
                <li class="text-wrapper-part">
                    <strong>Diversify your holdings:</strong> Don't put all of your money into just one or two stocks.
                    Even if you're investing only a relatively small amount of money to start, diversify your portfolio
                    by buying a few shares of several different stocks. With the advent of commission-free trading,
                    owning the stocks of many different companies does not incur any additional expense.

                3. Decide how many shares to buy
            </h3>
            <p>
                To determine how many shares you should buy, first decide how much money you want to invest in each
                stock that interests you and then divide this amount by the stock's current share price. You can find
                stock prices on your brokerage's platform by searching for either the stock's ticker symbol or the name
                of the company.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your brokerage trades fractional shares, you can purchase any dollar amount of a stock regardless of
                its share price. Many brokerages don't buy or sell fractional shares, so in that case you'd need to
                round down to the nearest whole number of shares to determine how many you can buy.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an example, let's say you want to invest $1,000 in Microsoft (MSFT 0.8%). You check Microsoft's share
                price and find that it's $149.50. Dividing $1,000 by this share price indicates that you can buy up to
                6.7 shares. Assuming your brokerage doesn't trade fractional shares, you would purchase six shares of
                Microsoft stock.

                4. Choose an order type
            </h3>
            <p>
                Different order types exist for stock purchases. The type of order you place to buy stock specifies the
                conditions under which you want your broker to transact on your behalf. Placing a "market order," which
                instructs your broker to buy the stock immediately and at the best available price, is typically the
                best order type for buy-and-hold investors.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, you may instead want to place a "limit order," which indicates to your broker the maximum price
                for a stock that you're willing to pay. For example, if a stock is currently trading for $20.50 per
                share, and you want to buy it only when the price is less than $20, then you would place a limit order.
                Your broker would only transact on your behalf if the stock's price dips below $20.
            </p>

                5. Place the stock order with your brokerage
            </h3>
            <p>
                To place a stock order, access the appropriate section of your brokerage's platform and enter the
                required information. Your brokerage will typically ask for the company or stock ticker name, whether
                you want to buy or sell shares, and the dollar amount or how many shares you want.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you tap the "place order" button, your stock purchase should be executed in a matter of seconds
                (if the order type is a market order). Your portfolio should immediately update to reflect your
                ownership of the newly purchased shares.

                6. Build your portfolio
            </h3>
            <p>
                The final step in this process is to build out your investment portfolio. Now that you have a brokerage
                account and know the basics of how to buy and sell stocks, you can keep adding money to your brokerage
                account and investing in stocks you'd like to own for years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a final thought, while it can be tempting to monitor the performance of your stocks every day
                (especially at first), it's important to maintain a long-term mindset. Certainly you can and should read
                quarterly reports and subscribe to news alerts to stay current on each of the companies in which you
                hold stock. But if your stocks' prices decline somewhat, don't sell in a panic. And, if your stocks'
                prices rise by a few dollars, resist the urge to cash out. The best, and easiest, way to build wealth
                over time is to buy shares of great companies and hold them for as long as the companies remain great.
