                        as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Several of the best stock brokersnow allow investors to buy
                        and sell cryptocurrencies alongside their stocks, mutual funds, and other investments. These
                        platforms can be desktop-based, app-based, or both.

                        Exchanges. A cryptocurrency exchange facilitates the buying and selling of digital currencies.
                        The biggest difference is that brokerages offer other investment vehicles. Cryptocurrency
                        exchanges don't.

                <p>A cryptocurrency exchange is a company that facilitates cryptocurrency transactions. A cryptocurrency
                    exchange facilitates the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies only.

                    By definition, a broker is an intermediary between two parties. It typically involves a financial
                    transaction. For example, a real estate broker facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers
                    of real estate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, technically speaking, cryptocurrency exchanges can be considered brokers. However, as we
                    discussed above, a crypto broker is a type of investment platform. And brokerages that offer
                    cryptocurrency trading alongside other investments, like stocks and bonds, might allow users to buy
                    and sell cryptocurrencies as well as stocks, mutual funds, and other types of investments.

                    already have your own cryptocurrency ready to trade.

                    It depends. There are more than 4,000 (not a typo) different cryptocurrencies in existence, and some
                    are far more legit than others. Most investors should stick to bitcoin and other large, established
                    digital currencies. Avoid the newer and smaller varieties.
